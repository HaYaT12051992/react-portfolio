# Portfolio Setup & Run

This workspace includes a simple portfolio scaffold using React + Vite + Tailwind CSS with component layouts inspired by shadcn/ui patterns.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies and the icons package:

```powershell
npm install
npm install lucide-react
```

2. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Files added under `src/components`:
- `Navbar.jsx`
- `Hero.jsx`
- `Projects.jsx`
- `Experience.jsx`
- `Education.jsx`
- `Contact.jsx`

Notes:
- Tailwind CSS is assumed to already be configured in the project.
- `lucide-react` is used for icons; you can replace with your preferred icon set.
- The contact form is a static form — wire it to an email provider or backend as needed.
